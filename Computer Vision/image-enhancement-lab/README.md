# Image Enhancement Laboratory

## Overview
The goal of this laboratory is to familiarize ourselves with techniques and tools commonly used for image enhancement, including noise reduction, detail enhancement, and more. 

We will focus on the following techniques:
- Transformation functions or intensity adjustment
- Histogram processing
- Arithmetic operators

Image enhancement is a crucial task in image preprocessing, significantly impacting the quality, interpretability, and utility of images across various applications, from medicine to computer vision and remote sensing. This phase aims to optimize visual information, correct imperfections, and highlight key features before applying analytical techniques or more advanced algorithms.

It's important to note that image enhancement techniques are problem-oriented; a technique suitable for enhancing an X-ray image may not be the best choice for improving a satellite image.

## Data Source
For this activity, we will use four images from The Dark Face database, which provides 6,000 real low-light images captured at night in various environments, including educational buildings, streets, bridges, walkways, and parks.

## Objectives
1. Enhance these images using the various image processing techniques described above.
2. Conduct a thorough comparison of these enhancement techniques, identify their limitations, and discuss potential solutions. This comprehensive approach not only allows for the practical application of learned concepts but also encourages critical analysis and the pursuit of innovative solutions in the image enhancement process.

## Image Dataset
You can find the images for processing in the [The Dark Face database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/dark-face-dataset).
